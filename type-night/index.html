  <h5 class="section-heading">Summary</h5>
  <p>Hand-lettering is a medium I’ve always wanted to explore and try. So I challenge myself to hand-letter random words, phrases, and quotes that struck me naturally for 30 days and nights. This began around the early of August of 2013.</p>

  <p>Type Night was a side project I initiated as an outcome of my 30 Nights of Type/Hand-Lettering challenge, which started on August 6th, 2013. I would sketched random words, phrases, and quotes that struck me naturally and posted them to my Instagram feed. Some of the words are just pure result of silliness and just for fun.</p>

  <p>Although I haven’t posted for a while, I do plan to get on it one of these days as soon as things settles down.</p>

  <p>Below are hand picked examples of my work. You can see all them <a href="http://{{ page.link }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
